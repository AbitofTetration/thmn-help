Hello!

I wasn't able to find a way to message you, so I'm making this fake pull request so I can tell you this.

I found your [thmn-help](https://touhoumon-crimson-help.netlify.app/) site, and I think it's really cool!

My only concern is that on the [more page](https://touhoumon-crimson-help.netlify.app/more/) it says the page is made by me and to contact me. I would appreciate if you updated this message to make it clear this page is forked from [pkmn.help](https://pkmn.help) itself and I don't manage it directly.

Thanks,  
Brian
